## 🏗️ Architecture
GoalZilla follows the MVP (Model-View-Presenter) architectural pattern:

Model: Manages data, logic, and rules of the application
View: Displays information to users and handles user interaction
Presenter: Acts as a bridge between the Model and View
The app also implements SOLID principles to ensure maintainable, scalable code.

## 🔄 API Integration
